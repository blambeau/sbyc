= SByC

This project is a Proof of Concept of a typing system relying on Specialization By Constraint. It allows developers to create new types and subtypes somewhat declaratively, that is, without having to create classes manually:

  PosInt = Integer.such_that{|i| i > 0}
  puts PosInt === 12   # -> true 
  puts PosInt === -1   # -> false
  
More examples and demos a bit later.
